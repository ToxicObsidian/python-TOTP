# python-TOTP
A Basic implementation of TOTP

## Usage:
```Python3
from TOTP import TOTP

totp = TOTP(key = b'some key')
# or
totp = TOTP(key = 'b32encoded key')

# You can get the key by
totp.Key

# Default is 6
totp.CodeDigits = 8

# Default is 30
totp.AliveDuration = 60
# also equal to
totp.TimeStep = 60

# Default is 0
totp.StartTS = 10

# Current TOTP Code generated by HMAC-SHA-1
totp.TOTP1()

# Current TOTP Code generated by HMAC-SHA-256
totp.TOTP256()

# Current TOTP Code generated by HMAC-SHA-512
totp.TOTP512()

unix_timestamp = 1234567890

# TOTP Code at specific time generated by HMAC-SHA-1
totp.TOTP1(unix_timestamp)

# TOTP Code at specific time generated by HMAC-SHA-256
totp.TOTP256(unix_timestamp)

# TOTP Code at specific time generated by HMAC-SHA-512
totp.TOTP512(unix_timestamp)
```
